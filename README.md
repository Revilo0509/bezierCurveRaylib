# bezierCurveRaylib
Just a project i wanted to save, it's a bezier curve implemented with raylib without using the buildin raylib function.\
It has an "Feature Packed" editor (not really) and the Bezier Curves implementation.

## Controls
Left-Click + Drag: Move a point\
Right-Click: Add a point\
\
Scroll: Change the purple direction\
Left-Shift + Scroll: Change the blue direction\
Hold-Control: Change direction faster\

## See the ✨Bezier Curves✨
Make sure you have **Two** points, and that the blue "line" from the first point intersects with the purple "line" from the second point.

## Building
Make sure you you have raylib accessible to cmake using the find_package() function and a c++ compiler and run the Cmake and it *SHOULD* compile.
